Question:  
Which is an interesting data set you discovered recently? Why is it your favorite? 
No datasets on Kaggle, please.

Answer: 
Recently I was reading about a Dataset called AudioSet.

It is a large-scale collection of human-labeled 10-second sound clips drawn from 
YouTube videos. It consists of an expanding ontology of 632 audio event classes and a collection of 
2,084,320 human-labeled 10-second sound clips drawn from YouTube videos. 
The ontology is specified as a hierarchical graph of event categories, covering a wide range of 
human and animal sounds, musical instruments and genres, and common everyday environmental sounds.

AudioSet is interesting because it provides a common, realistic-scale evaluation task for audio event 
detection and a starting point for a comprehensive vocabulary of sound events. It endeavors to bridge the 
gap in data availability between image and audio research.
